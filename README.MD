# SunTracking
Sun Tracking Library for Arduino
## AS SOMEONE STATED, THIS LIBRARY DOES NOT WORK CORRECTLY DUE TO RIGHT ASCENSION BEING UNDERESTIMATED
This library is not working right now, if you want to fix it, feel free to pull request. I will do it when I have spare time.
### What is it?

This Library has been developed for Solar Trackers, used to harvest more energy from the Sun. Given a position and a date ( between 1990 and 2100 due to approximations), it returns Azimuth (the angle from North Pole, clockwise) and Elevation (the angle from the horizon) [Horizontal Coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_coordinate_system).

### How it works
This library is based on the algorithms developed by Jean Meeus ([Cap. 5 Astronomical Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Astronomical-Algorithms-Jean-Meeus/dp/0943396352)).
