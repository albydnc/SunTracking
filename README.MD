# SunTracking
Sun Tracking Library for Arduino

### What is it?

This Library has been developed for Solar Trackers, used to harvest more energy from the Sun. Given a position and a date ( between 1990 and 2100 due to approximations), it returns Azimuth (the angle from North Pole, clockwise) and Elevation (the angle from the horizon) [Horizontal Coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_coordinate_system).

### How it works
This library is based on the algorithms developed by Jean Meeus ([Cap. 25 Astronomical Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Astronomical-Algorithms-Jean-Meeus/dp/0943396352)).

### Release log:
- 9/2023: fixed calculations, now reporting correct results.
